The full monthly Subscription Fee for each Subscription Plan will be displayed at the time of purchase including, where applicable, any introductory pricing for a specified period. The applicable Subscription Fee will become payable on the date that you sign up to the Subscription Plan, and will be payable monthly until termination of your Subscription Plan (“Subscription Fee Period”).

<br>
We may increase your Subscription Fee at any time by giving at least 21 days’ notice to you. We will provide this notice to you by email to the email address linked to your account. Any increase in the Subscription Fee will be effective on your next Subscription Fee Period payment date. If you do not agree to any increase in your Subscription Fee, you may cancel your Subscription Plan through your account.
<br>
We may also increase your Subscription Fee without notice if required by law, or if any regulatory authority requests or requires a change to any part of our pricing which directly affects your Subscription Fee or our pricing structure. If this happens, we will use best endeavours to give you reasonable notice. If you do not agree to that increase in your Subscription Fee, you may cancel your Subscription Plan through your account.
<br>
You may cancel your Subscription Plan through your account at any time. Your cancellation of your Subscription Plan will be effective at the end of that Subscription Fee Period, and your Subscription Plan will be discontinued from this date.
<br>
You will only receive a pro rata refund of any fees or other amounts already paid to us if:
<br>
you cancel as a result of us changing these Terms or our Privacy Policy in a way that you do not agree with, in which case, you must notify us within 14 days of our notice to you about that change, and your cancellation will be effective as of the date of the change to these Terms or our Privacy Policy; or
<br>
you cancel as a result of an increased Subscription Fee pursuant to these Terms, in which case, you will be entitled to a pro rata refund of any amounts paid by you of the higher Subscription Fee, and your cancellation will be effective immediately.
<br>
You can choose your Subscription Plan when you create a Page. If you already have a Page, you can upgrade or downgrade your Subscription Plan at any time in the “profile” on the Website.
<br>
If you upgrade your Subscription Plan, you will be able to access your new Subscription Plan immediately. The new Subscription Fee will be applied pro rata for the remainder of your Subscription Fee Period (unless you are in a free trial) and you will be charged immediately upon upgrade. The full new Subscription Fee will be applied at start of the next Subscription Fee Period.
<br>
If you wish to downgrade your Subscription Plan, the downgrade will take effect at the end of that Subscription Fee Period (or free trial if applicable). If applicable, the full new Subscription Fee will be applied at the start of the next Subscription Fee Period.
<br>
You may also be able to purchase certain Services for a one-off Fee from time to time.
<br>
Promotions
<br>
Your access to a Page including your Subscription Plan may include a free trial period, or other promotional discount or benefit (“Promotions”). We reserve the right to offer, withdraw, change, cancel or determine your eligibility for any Promotion in our absolute discretion.
<br>
Some Promotions may run for a certain specified period of time that will be displayed on the Website (“Promotion Period”).
<br>
Your credit card may be charged a small nominal amount to verify your credit card, but this verification charge will be refunded without you needing to take any further action.
<br>
It is your responsibility to know when your Promotion, and the applicable Subscription Fee for your Subscription Plan once the Promotion has ended.
<br>
You acknowledge that at the conclusion of the Promotion, we will commence billing you the monthly Subscription Fee if applicable for your then current Subscription Plan in accordance with these Terms, unless you:
<br>
cancel your Subscription Plan prior to the end of the Promotional Period; or
<br>
downgrade your Subscription Plan to a free Subscription Plan prior to the end of the Promotional Period.
<br>
We reserve the right to offer, withdraw, change, cancel or determine your eligibility for any Promotion or free trial in our discretion for the purposes of preventing abuse of the Promotion or free trial. Promotions and free trials may be subject to terms and conditions published on the Website, which shall apply in addition to and prevail to the extent of any inconsistency with these Terms.
<br>
Orders of Retail Products
<br>

<br>
If you make an Order, you:
<br>
agree to pay the price of the Retail Products and the applicable delivery fee;
<br>
warrant to us that all information provided by you in relation to that Order is accurate, complete and current; and
<br>
warrant to us that the Retail Products the subject of your Order are intended for personal, domestic or household use and are not intended for commercial use.
<br>

We reserve the right to ask you to provide additional details or to verify your identity before Memories processes your Order. Unless you cancel your Order, acceptance of your Order and the contract between you and Memories will be completed when:
<br>
for physical products, we (or our authorised agents) email you to confirm that your Order has been dispatched and has been handed over to the designated carrier; or
<br>
for virtual products, the products are sent to the gift recipient via email or the products are posted to the recipient’s Page after purchase.
<br>
Completion of Orders is subject to the availability of the Retail Products.
<br>
In certain circumstances, the Retail Products will be supplied by a Partner.
<br>
We reserve the right not to accept your Order in the event that we are unable to obtain authorisation for payment, the item is out of stock or for any other reason that we reasonably determine. If applicable, we may reject Orders for delivery outside of Australia or to rural or remote locations or to post office boxes or postal lockers within Australia.
<br>
If you place an Order for someone else to receive the Retail Products, you must obtain their consent before providing Memories with their personal information and, by placing an Order, you confirm to Memories that you have done this.
<br>
Memories reserves the right to cancel, at any time before delivery for whatever reason, an Order that it has previously accepted. Memories may be able to do this, for example but without limitation, where:
<br>
Memories’ suppliers are unable to supply the Retail Products that they have previously promised to supply;
<br>
an event beyond the control of Memories, such as a storm, fire, flood, earthquake, terrorism, power failure, war, strike or failure of computer systems means that Memories is unable to supply the Retail Products within a reasonable time;
<br>
Retail Products ordered were subject to an error on the Website, for example, in relation to a description, price or image, which was not discovered prior to the Order being accepted; or
<br>
you ask Memories to cancel your Order in accordance with these Terms.
<br>
If we cancel your Order under these Terms, we will refund to you all monies you have paid pursuant to the cancelled Order.
<br>
Pricing of Retail Products

<br>

Prices for Retail Products and delivery fees for Orders are listed on the Website and, unless otherwise specified, are in Australian Dollars and are inclusive of any applicable Australian taxes, including GST.

<br>

To the maximum extent permitted by law, we will not be liable for and you forever release and discharge us from any claims you may have against us for any direct, indirect, special, consequential or other damages that result from, are connected with, arise out of, or are incidental to that delay, unless the delay is caused by our negligence.

Our approach to Safeguarding
<br>
Principles
<br>
Our approach to Safeguarding is driven by a number of principles which are informed by the UNCRC, all applicable Australian and overseas Child Protection laws and by Memories’ values and understanding of best practice, specifically:

Zero Tolerance: Memories has a zero tolerance to Child Exploitation and Abuse;

Protection from Harm: all Children have a right to protection from harm and abuse, regardless of age, ability, gender, racial heritage, religious beliefs, sexual orientation, identity or additional vulnerabilities;

Best Interests of the Child: the best interests of the Child are paramount in all considerations about their welfare and protection, including when to maintain confidentiality and when to share information about them; and

Sharing Responsibility: to effectively manage risks to Children, Memories requires commitment, support and cooperation of Personnel and Affiliates. We will escalate our concerns in our efforts to be satisfied that the Child has been protected, taking a stand in cases where we consider the protection of the Child has not been taken seriously either within Memories or those investigating Child Protection.

Memories understands that the Child's welfare is paramount and this means that the Child's safety and protection must be the most important consideration and take priority over everything else. These procedures outline what action should be taken if you have concerns about a Child's Safeguarding including Child Protection.

<br>
The UNCRC is the foundation of Memories’ work on Child Safeguarding. Children’s rights as enshrined in the convention act as the motivation for both our internal and external Child protection measures and activities.

Our approach to Safeguarding
<br>
Principles
<br>
Our approach to Safeguarding is driven by a number of principles which are informed by the UNCRC, all applicable Australian and overseas Child Protection laws and by Memories’ values and understanding of best practice, specifically:

Zero Tolerance: Memories has a zero tolerance to Child Exploitation and Abuse;

Protection from Harm: all Children have a right to protection from harm and abuse, regardless of age, ability, gender, racial heritage, religious beliefs, sexual orientation, identity or additional vulnerabilities;

Best Interests of the Child: the best interests of the Child are paramount in all considerations about their welfare and protection, including when to maintain confidentiality and when to share information about them; and

Sharing Responsibility: to effectively manage risks to Children, Memories requires commitment, support and cooperation of Personnel and Affiliates. We will escalate our concerns in our efforts to be satisfied that the Child has been protected, taking a stand in cases where we consider the protection of the Child has not been taken seriously either within Memories or those investigating Child Protection.

Memories understands that the Child's welfare is paramount and this means that the Child's safety and protection must be the most important consideration and take priority over everything else. These procedures outline what action should be taken if you have concerns about a Child's Safeguarding including Child Protection.
